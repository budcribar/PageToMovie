# Learning loop (review → smarter prompts)

Operator path. Architecture: [film-provenance…](film-provenance-critic-learning-architecture.md). Older twin archived: [docs/archive/learning_loop.md](archive/learning_loop.md).

## Phases

| Phase | What |
|--------|------|
| **P0** | Host `_learning/review_events.jsonl` + project edit log; before/after on apply; `regen_after_review` on single-clip gen |
| **P1** | Admin **Learning** page + `/api/admin/learning/*` insights/events |
| **P2** | *(retired)* Runtime prompt packs — auto-review checklist lives in `prompts/clip_auto_review.txt` |
| **P3** | Propose rules from last N fails (chat or offline fallback) |
| **P4** | Project `project_rules.json` suggest from categories → admin approve → inject into gen/auto-review |

## Paths

- Host events: `{WorkspaceRoot}/_learning/review_events.jsonl`
- Global prompts (embed at build): `prompts/clip_auto_review.txt`, cast/fountain prompts
- Project rules: `{project}/project_rules.json`

## Operator flow

1. Users Fail / Auto Review / Apply / Regen on Review.
2. Admin opens **Learning**, filters by project, reads fail categories.
3. Improve **global** rules by editing the prompt files in git, PR, redeploy (rollback = git history).
4. For a project: **Suggest from fails** → **Approve** house rules (project-scoped injection).
